H. Balanced Search Trees

1. Give a formula for the exact height of a binary search tree (as you
   implemented in homework 6) as a function of N if we insert N values in
   increasing order.

Worst case the height can be the number of elements, so a tree with N values would have a height of N.

2. Give a formula for the exact height of a 2-4 tree in terms of N if 
   we insert N values in increasing order.

The height would be log2(N).
